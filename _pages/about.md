# Research Interests
<font size="3">
Currently, I am interested in a wide range of research problems, spanning computer architecture, VLSI design and various other areas that deal with the hardware-software interface. <br/>
Thanks to my undergraduate experiences, I have been to a number of interesting topics such as:<br/>

<ul>
<li>Low-power, energy-efficient architectures/systems</li>
<li>Hardware accelerators <font size="2"> (not necessarily for neural net computations, but ML seems to be the *real deal* these days)</font></li>
<li>Open-source and agile hardware development</li>
</ul>
Not listed above, I have recently become fascinated with warehouse-scale computers and related problems on designing  hardware to support efficient distributed computing. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I consider myself a visual thinker, and I find graphics and computer vision to be interesting application domains.
