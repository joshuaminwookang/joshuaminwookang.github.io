Hi, I'm an undergrduate student at <span style="color:#512698">Williams College (*Go Ephs!*)</span>, where I am <br/> double-majoring in Computer Science and Physics. 

For a summary of my experiences, please check out my <a href="/files/kang_resume.pdf", style="color:black">

### Research Interests
Currently, I am interested in a wide range of research problems, spanning computer architecture, VLSI design and various other areas that deal with the hardware-software interface. Thanks to my undergraduate experiences, I have been to a number of interesting topics such as:

* Low-power, energy-efficient architectures/systems
* Hardware accelerators <font size="2"> (not necessarily for neural net computations, but ML seems to be the *real deal* these days)</font>
* Open-source and agile hardware development

Not listed above, but I have recently become fascinated with warehouse-scale computers and related problems on designing  hardware to support efficient distributed computing. 

Also, I consider myself a visual thinker, and topics on graphics and computer vision has always intrigued me.

**Trivia**

* I was born and raised in South Korea--for the most part, I lived in the outskirts of Seoul.
* From '15 to '17, I served in the South Korean Army, stationed at the [Joint Security Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Security_Area). 
* I enjoy watching and playing football (~~soccer~~), though I've never been a varsity athelete.
