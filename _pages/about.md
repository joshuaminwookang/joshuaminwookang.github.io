###Hi, 
I am an undergrduate student at <span style="color:purple">Williams College (Go Ephs!) </span>, where I am double-majoring in Computer Science and Physics. I have research experiences in computer architecture and soft matter physics--please check out the [research](/research/) page for more details.

#### Research Interests
Currently, I am interested in a wide range of research problems, spanning computer architecture, VLSI design and various other areas that deal with the hardware-software interface. Thanks to my undergraduate experiences, I have been to a number of interesting topics such as:

* Low-power, energy-efficient architectures/systems
* Hardware accelerators (not necessarily for neural net computations, but ML seems to be the *real deal* these days)
* Open-source and agile hardware development (ta-da, the future) 

Not listed above, but I have recently become fascinated with warehouse-scale computers and related problems on designing  hardware to support efficient distributed computing. 

Also, I consider myself a visual thinker, and topics on graphics and computer vision has always intrigued me.
