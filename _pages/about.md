<p style="font-size: 28p; color color: #512698"> About me </p> <br/>

<p style="font-size: 12p">

Hi, I'm an undergrduate student at Williams College <font size="2" color="#512698"> (<i>Go Ephs!</i>)</font>, where I am <br/> double-majoring in Computer Science and Physics. 

<br/>
For a summary of my experiences, please check out my <a href="/files/kang_resume.pdf" style="color: #512698;">

<p style="font-size: 28p; color color: #512698"> Research Interests </p> <br/>
<p style="font-size: 12p">

Currently, I am interested in a wide range of research problems, spanning computer architecture, VLSI design and various other areas that deal with the hardware-software interface. Thanks to my undergraduate experiences, I have been to a number of interesting topics such as:<br/>

<ul>
<li>Low-power, energy-efficient architectures/systems</li>
<li>Hardware accelerators <font size="2"> (not necessarily for neural net computations, but ML seems to be the *real deal* these days)</font></li>
<li>Open-source and agile hardware development</li>
</ul>
Not listed above, but I have recently become fascinated with warehouse-scale computers and related problems on designing  hardware to support efficient distributed computing. <br/>

Also, I consider myself a visual thinker, and topics on graphics and computer vision has always intrigued me.
